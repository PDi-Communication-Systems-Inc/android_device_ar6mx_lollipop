# Basic Parameters
touch.deviceType = touchScreen
#touch.orientationAware = 1

# Touch Size
touch.touchSize.calibration = default

# Tool Size
touch.toolSize.calibration = default

# Pressure
touch.pressure.calibration = default

# Size
touch.size.calibration = default

# Orientation
touch.orientation.calibration = none

# The value is 0, the device is external.
# The value is 1, the device is internal.
# Internal input devices generally do not wake the display from sleep.
# Unless explicitly configured to do so in the key layout file or in a hardcoded policy rule.
